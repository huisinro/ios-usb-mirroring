# ios-usb-mirroring

I've understood Apple's iOS USB mirroring protocol on Mac, yes, the one can be used to mirror iOS devices to a Mac desktop computer. 

This project contains source code of the implementation for the same iOS USB Mirroring protocol on Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, Raspberry Pi, etc.
With this independent implementation, iOS devices can be mirrored to any platforms using the lightning cable. No sotware is required to install to
the iOS devices.

A screenshot is available here: (scren and audio is supported).
